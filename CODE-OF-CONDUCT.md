# Code of Conduct
hello-world has a team of talented, respectful developers, as well as a community of engaged users, both dedicated and contributing to ensure any individual experience with our program is a fulfilling one.
To ensure that such is the case, those who contribute directly with development and counsel as well as community members who participate in discussion of our product and feedback must obey a list of guidelines to ensure everyone is not only respected, but feels welcomed and comfortable.
---
# Expected Behaviour Guideline
1. Be respectful and patient with everyone; not everyone is fortunate to live with the same privilidges as you or others may, therefore, be accomodating to ensure others feel welcomed and respected.
2. Be considerate and open-minded; you are not expected to agree with everyone however you must, as they to you, respect the right to hold an opinion.
3. Do not impersonate or plagiarize; you are expected to credit the original author of any borrowed code/artwork/resource and to not get others into trouble by impersonation.
4. Discrimination; on the basis of sex, gender, racism and etc will not be tolerated.

# Reporting & Enforcing
If you find yourself or others violating any of the guidelines listed above, you should report the identity to any member of the dev team, and provide evidence or direction to the offense.
If you happen to be the perpetrator, whether accidentally or on purpose, you are encouraged to self-report. Honesty comes a long way and is in general, a good policy.
Punishment is dependant on the individual offense and will vary from case to case, but may range from:
- Exclusion from future development stages (not permanent).
- Expulsion (kick, ban, etc) from community networks.
- Dismissed from the dev team if applicable.
- Rehabilitation training.

# Who may contribute as a developer?
Anyone willing to obey our guidelines above and interested in developing the future of our product. However, you must apply with us to be able to determine if the former is the case. You may do so by contacting us.

# What is a community member?
A community member may simply be, or not even be, a member of our product, but could just be an enthusiast or a prospective user with questions about the program.
